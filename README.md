### Project descripti√≥n

I have developed a frontend web application to simulate the management of appointments in a beauty center, using the tools of React vite, mui core, mysql wokbench, postman to generate different managements. New users must register and log in, then they will be able to see the different treatments to schedule an appointment, view their profile. Users with the admin role will be able to see all treatments, create, update and delete them.

### Grateful

First of all to my colleagues who have contributed their opinions at opportune moments to make all the information seen in the classroom more fluid, to the existence of applications such as stack overflow, tutorials on the subject.
